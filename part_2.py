Part 2:
Building Document Vectors for Web Page Content Analysis
A document can be represented as a Bag of Words where a document is represented in a |V|
dimensional vector where |V| is a set of all the unique terms that occur in the entire collection
of the documents (called Dictionary) as the features with a weight score in Term Frequency(TF)
- the frequency of each term occurring in each document - and Inverted Document Frequency.
For this transformation, you have to build an Inverted Index (which is a Term Look_Up Table or
Term Dictionary with Term Frequency (TF) and Document Frequency (DF). See how to build an
Inverted Index for TF-IDF in Slides 10 â€“ 14 in the Lecture Notes.
